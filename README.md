Hangman

In this project I learned the following :

• How to better use Visual Studio : how to create and add classes, and how to make a code more readable by minimizing a block of code to continue working and have more space.
• That a class could have variables inside (I need to look more into that and about 'constructors' too).
• How to encapsulate and use { get; set; } (the surface, I also need to deepen my knowledge about that).
• How to better manage while loops and the conditions.
• I learned about the Random & Next methods, Add, break, ToUpper, IndexOf, ReadKey and what ReadKey(true) does.
• How to create lists and lists of lists.

I also took the habit to always comment my code, even a bit too much.

What I struggled on :

• When I changed my maxErrors for my healthPlayer, I struggled making it work at first because I had not seen I had put the information in the wrong condition of my while loop. After a test I did with Guillaume Patrice (GitHub :  https://github.com/Stormahaaz1515) - he was able to help out and find the solution, which I thank him very much for !

• I wanted to add something more, a while loop to ask the user if they'd like to play again (y/n answers), but it wouldn't work and I didn't have time so it is not yet in my project and I plan on trying to add it very soon again and figure out how to fix the issues I was having (it worked in my small calculator project I made so I know I'll figure it out somehow aha).
